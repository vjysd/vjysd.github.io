# Vijay Sadashivaiah

I&rsquo;m a PhD Student in Computer Science at the [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) (RPI). My research interests lie in the area of human-inspired methods to advance artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Specifically, I am interested in exploring how the human brain abstracts away knowledge from one context/environment and later uses it to learn quickly and efficiently in new contexts. Compared to existing methods in artificial intelligence, humans demonstrate far superior performance in key areas, including the efficiency, transferability, and generalizability of learning. I received a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the [PES Institute of Technology](https://pes.edu) and a Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu).

Before coming to RPI,  I was a Staff Scientist at [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org) where I explored novel data-driven methods on heterogeneous datasets to identify the underlying biological pathways involved in Schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

This is my [NeuroTree](https://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=184853) and my Erd≈ës number is [4](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/vijay-sadashivaiah/paul-erdos).

I was born in [Bangalore, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) but spent most of my time growing up in [Tumkur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumkur). I enjoy rock climbing, hiking and backpacking. I've hiked (or climbed or backpacked) in Hawaii, South Korea, Switzerland, India and USA.
