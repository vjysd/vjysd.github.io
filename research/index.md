> ### Machine learning of neuroimaging data
> {% include project-stub.md  

title="lieber_ml" 

description="I'm exploring novel data driven methods to analyze neuroimaging, genetic and physiological data. Specifically, I'm building models to identify the underlying biological pathways in Schizophrenia. Developed models are based on Deep Neural Network (CNN's) and Support Vector Machine frameworks."

> ### Multi-model data analysis of imaging genetics data
> {% include project-stub.md  

title="lieber_mm" 

description="Multi-modal data collected for the  same subjects have become common in neuroscience research. Simultaneously studying such data may yield new information that could not be observed in analyzing individual data. In this study, we used three-way parallel ICA to incorporate two fMRI tasks and genotype data."
